        tagNames:["about", "history"],

        HeadingOne: `The Sahel region in West Africa is marked by the quiet beauty of
        its landscapes, and the rich, varied cultures of its people.`,
        paraOne: `It also faces one of the world’s fastest-growing humanitarian
        emergencies. Driven by conflict, insecurity, climate change and
        wide-spread poverty, around 30 million people need lifesaving aid
        — more than ever before. Some 5.5 million people have been
        uprooted and violent attacks are a daily reality. About half of
        the population is under 15 years old, and the surge in armed
        violence is having a devastating impact on children’s survival,
        safety, education and hopes for a better future. The idea for
        Sahel Song was sparked in 2020 when Vieux Farka Touré first joined
        forces with the UN to raise awareness and funds for humanitarian
        action in the Sahel. Other artists were quick to add their voices
        and talent, eager to help shift the prevailing narrative about the
        region from despair to hope. Almost a year in the making, the
        multi-lingual track tackles the most pressing issues at the heart
        of the crisis, including conflict, poverty and the climate
        emergency. But it also celebrates the resilience and hope that
        characterize people across the Sahel, offering a rallying cry for
        youth across the region.`,
        paraTwo: `But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
        happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
        because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
        pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
        extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
        or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
        because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
        can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
        with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
        consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
        pleasure?`,
